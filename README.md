# West Buy Carousel
The West Buy carousel is a responsive microservice that serves as a component in
a western-themed product page cloned after Best Buy's e-commerce site.

The "People Also Bought" carousel renders previews of multiple items within the
same product category as the primary item being viewed, and the "Most Viewed Items"
carousel renders the top ten items viewed on West Buy.  Both carousels function
independently of one another.  

The carousel is styled using the CSS-in-JS styled-components library.  The animations
are rendered using CSS transforms.

## Full West Buy Application
West Buy employs service-oriented architecture, combining five microservices into
one application.  Additionally, the team created a components library for a stars
graphic that was rendered across multiple services via a proxy server.
